# TerminalPaint

**TerminalPaint** is a basic paint application running in the terminal.
The application features a color picker as well as loading and saving of images.
The color picker provides access to a small palette of colors supported on a wide range of platforms (e.g. Windows, Linux, and MacOS).
Image loading and saving uses a custom image format, which intentionally is not compatible with other tools.
The application itself is written in C# with .NET Core.

We use this application for teaching programming at the [School of Engineering](https://fh-ooe.at/en/campus-wels) of the [University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria](https://fh-ooe.at/en).
According to our experience, the application is simple enough to be fully unterstood even by beginners, but interesting enough to motivate students to work on the assigments.

*Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰*
